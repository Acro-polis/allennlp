Crucially, each list of integers for each word has been padded to the length of the maximum word in the sentence. Note that the keys for the dictionary of `token_indexers` for the `TextField` are different from the `namespaces`. This is because it's possible to re-use a `namespace` in different `TokenIndexers`. In the [Embedding Tokens notebook](embedding_tokens.ipynb) tutorial, we'll see that the keys allow us to create a 1-1 mapping between how tokens are _indexed_ with `TokenIndexers` and _embedded_ with `TokenEmbedders`."
